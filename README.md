# Game_Development

This project is a research-driven initiative where I am utilizing the Unity game engine, with C# as the primary programming language, to develop an educational game based on the MARIE assembly language and instruction set. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and engaging platform for learning and understanding the MARIE architecture, its operations, and instruction execution.

Through this project, I aim to combine technical expertise in game development with instructional design to enhance educational experiences in computer architecture and assembly language programming.
